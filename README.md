# Ethylene Distillation Digital Twin Platform

This project presents a simulation and visualization platform for an ethylene distillation column, developed using MATLAB, Simulink, and AppDesigner.

## Project Overview

A dynamic model of the distillation process was built using mass and energy balance equations. The digital twin provides a real-time interface for observing system behavior and adjusting process parameters.

### Features

- **Dynamic Modeling**: Core mechanism based on fundamental process control equations.
- **Interactive UI**: Developed in AppDesigner for real-time input and visualization.
- **Simulation Integration**: Linked with Simulink for time-based system response.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (version R2021a or later recommended)
- Simulink
- AppDesigner

## Getting Started

1. Open MATLAB and set this directory as your working folder.
2. Launch the UI `.mlapp` file in AppDesigner.
3. Start the simulation from the interface or Simulink model.
4. Adjust inputs to explore column behavior dynamically.

## Notes

- This platform was developed as part of a process control and modeling project.
- Suitable for education, demonstration, and early-stage digital twin testing.
